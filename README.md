# SFC
Program to generate simple SFC. The generated SFCs are intended to use together with simple photoediting software (i.e. paint) to create a complete SFC.

Both files need to be in the same directory. The program will generate a folder to store pictures in, default "Bilder", with the name of "SFC.png".

Edit perzonalization.py to change background color, file names and more.
